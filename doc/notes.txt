Most common attributes: (MJREC <= 8.5); (SDNTFTPT in ("2" "98" "99" )) or (SDNTFTPT in ("1" "94" )); (HALEMOPBXXXX in ("1" "2" "93" "94" )) or (HALEMOPBXXXX in ("91" "97" "98" ))
	Used MJ within past 12 months 
	work part time or blank/skip 
	work full time or don't know 
	_____
	never used hallucinogens, refused, blank 


Notes: 
Using MJ within past 12 months appears in all 7 rules.
	***More people who smoke MJ also smoke tobacco than vice versa b/c legality (a lot of cig smokers can't smoke mj) so rule makes sense (because just knowing they smoke MJ means they'll probably have smoked cig). MJ smokers often mix MJ and tobacco in a blunt to conserve and lower strength
Part/full time appears in all, mostly part time workers smoke cigarettes
Most confident 2 rules have first used MJ at 17.6 yrs or younger, first used alc 15.5 yrs or younger
	****Looks like to have smoked a cigarette, you're likely to have had the legal, easier obtained gateway drug alcohol around 15 for the first time, then moved on to the easiest obtained illegal drug MJ a few years later. 
	***First alcohol use between 15.5 and 17.5 years old also appears, more underage drinking=>cig use evidence
*****Never having used hallucinogens predicts having smoked a cig in 4 of 7 rules, could they be opposite drugs? News: Hallucinogens like MDMA and psilocybin used to treat both nicotine/cig addiction and alcoholism
Random last rule says older than 28 means likely to have smoked cig

Notes:

Ever used alcohol in all 7 rules
	Of those 5 rules with never had alcohol, 2 also say they're younger than 14.5
		*****Idea: Keeping alcohol away from children makes them less likely to ever smoke a cigarette
	Of those 2 rules with have had alcohol, both are followed by them being enrolled in any school. 
		*****So being in school is associated with alcohol but not cig use.
*****Top confidence rule rules out top 3 drugs (marijuana, alcohol, tobacco) in first 2 terms: No marijuana in a year or never at all, and no alcohol ever means no tobacco
4th year college education or lower in 4 rules
****Second most confident predicts never using cig from having never been booked for breaking the law

	Ever been booked/arrested
	Race


*****Cig=1 Best predictor is having sold illegal drugs, cig=2 best predictor is never having sold illegal drugs
	Except for cig=1 #4 which is only different one: they've never sold illegal drugs but most peers did cigarettes (only time that occurs) and they have been arrested 
*****Has been to a religious service 24 times or less in past 12 mo is cool indicator (appears twice)
*****Never been booked (rare, only 2 rules) appears exclusively with college enrollment (random) religious services (<24), and health (different)
